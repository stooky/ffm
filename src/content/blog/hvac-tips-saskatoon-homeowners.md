Living in Saskatoon means dealing with one of the most extreme climates in Canada. Our HVAC systems work overtime—battling -40°C winters and +35°C summer heat waves. Here are the tips we wish every homeowner knew.

## 1. Don't Ignore Strange Sounds

Your furnace and AC shouldn't make unusual noises. If you hear any of these, call a technician:

- **Banging or popping**: Could indicate delayed ignition or expanding/contracting ductwork
- **Squealing or screeching**: Often a belt or motor bearing issue
- **Rattling**: Loose components or debris in the system
- **Clicking** (continuous): Potential electrical or control issue

Many homeowners ignore unusual sounds, hoping they'll go away. They rarely do—and what starts as a minor repair often becomes a major expense if left unaddressed.

## 2. Seal Your Home Before Upgrading Your System

Before investing in a new furnace or AC, make sure your home is properly sealed. Air leaks can waste up to 30% of your heating and cooling energy. Check for:

- Gaps around windows and doors
- Unsealed electrical outlets on exterior walls
- Leaky ductwork in unheated spaces
- Insufficient attic insulation

A well-sealed, well-insulated home can often be comfortable with a smaller, less expensive HVAC system.

## 3. Understand Your Thermostat Settings

Simple thermostat strategies can save you money:

**Winter settings:**
- 20-21°C when you're home and awake
- 17-18°C when sleeping or away
- Don't turn it down more than 3-4 degrees at a time

**Summer settings:**
- 24-25°C when you're home
- 26-28°C when you're away
- Use the "auto" fan setting, not "on"

**Pro tip:** Every degree you lower your thermostat in winter saves about 3% on heating costs.

## 4. Don't Close Vents in Unused Rooms

It seems logical: close vents in unused rooms to save energy. But this common practice can actually:

- Increase pressure in your ductwork
- Cause leaks at duct joints
- Make your system work harder
- Lead to uneven temperatures throughout your home

Your HVAC system is designed to heat and cool your entire home. Closing vents throws off the balance.

## 5. Schedule Maintenance Before You Need It

The best time to service your furnace is fall. The best time to service your AC is spring. Why?

- Technicians aren't rushed and can take their time
- You'll avoid peak-season pricing
- Any issues get fixed before you actually need the system
- You won't be stuck waiting during a -35°C cold snap or a July heat wave

We see the same pattern every year: emergency calls spike during the first cold snap and the first heat wave. Those customers who scheduled maintenance in advance? They're comfortable at home while others are waiting for service.

## Bonus: Know When It's Time to Replace

No one wants to hear their HVAC system needs replacing, but sometimes it's the smart financial decision. Consider replacement if:

- Your furnace is 15-20+ years old
- Your AC is 10-15+ years old
- Repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost
- Your energy bills keep climbing despite maintenance
- Your system uses R-22 refrigerant (being phased out)

Modern high-efficiency systems can cut your energy bills significantly. In Saskatchewan's climate, that adds up fast.
