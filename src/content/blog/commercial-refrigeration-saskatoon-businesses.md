For restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, and other businesses that rely on refrigeration, a breakdown isn't just inconvenient—it can mean lost inventory and lost revenue. Here's what Saskatoon business owners need to know about keeping their walk-in coolers and freezers running reliably.

## Why Commercial Refrigeration Needs Special Attention

Commercial refrigeration systems work harder than residential units:

- **Continuous operation**: Running 24/7, 365 days a year
- **Heavy use**: Frequent door openings throughout the day
- **Critical temperatures**: Must maintain precise temperatures for food safety
- **Harsh conditions**: Operating through Saskatchewan's extreme temperature swings

This constant demand means commercial refrigeration requires regular maintenance to avoid costly breakdowns and food spoilage.

## Signs Your Walk-In Needs Attention

Watch for these warning signs:

- **Temperature fluctuations**: Unit not holding consistent temperature
- **Ice buildup**: Excessive frost on evaporator coils
- **Unusual sounds**: Grinding, clicking, or humming noises
- **Longer run times**: Compressor running constantly
- **Water on the floor**: Could indicate drain issues or door seal problems
- **Higher energy bills**: System working harder than it should

Don't wait for a complete failure. If you notice any of these issues, call for service before you lose inventory.

## Essential Maintenance Tasks

Regular maintenance can prevent most refrigeration emergencies:

### Daily Checks
- Monitor temperatures and log readings
- Check door seals for proper closure
- Clear any obstructions from air vents
- Ensure proper product organization for airflow

### Monthly Tasks
- Clean condenser coils (dust and grease reduce efficiency)
- Check door gaskets for wear or damage
- Inspect drain lines for clogs
- Clean interior surfaces

### Quarterly/Annual Service
- Professional inspection of all components
- Refrigerant level check
- Electrical connection inspection
- Compressor and motor assessment
- Calibrate thermostats and controls

## Temperature Best Practices

Maintaining proper temperatures protects both food safety and equipment:

**Walk-in Coolers:**
- Target: 35-38°F (1.5-3°C)
- Never above 40°F (4°C)

**Walk-in Freezers:**
- Target: 0°F (-18°C) or below
- Avoid temperature swings

**Tips for temperature management:**
- Don't overload the unit—airflow is essential
- Cool hot items before placing in the cooler
- Keep door openings brief
- Organize products to allow air circulation
- Install strip curtains to reduce cold air loss

## When to Call a Professional

Some issues require immediate professional attention:

- **Compressor not running**: Could be electrical or mechanical failure
- **Unusual noises from the compressor**: Sign of internal problems
- **Refrigerant leak**: Loss of cooling capacity, potential safety issue
- **Complete temperature loss**: Emergency situation for food safety
- **Electrical issues**: Tripping breakers, burning smell

Attempting DIY repairs on commercial refrigeration can void warranties, create safety hazards, and make problems worse. When in doubt, call a professional.

## Protecting Your Investment

A few best practices to extend equipment life:

1. **Schedule regular maintenance**: Preventative care is cheaper than emergency repairs
2. **Train staff**: Everyone should know proper door use and loading procedures
3. **Keep records**: Document temperatures, maintenance, and any issues
4. **Have a backup plan**: Know who to call for emergencies and have a plan for product if repairs take time
5. **Consider a maintenance agreement**: Regular scheduled service for peace of mind

## Emergency Planning

Every business should have a refrigeration emergency plan:

- Post emergency contact numbers where staff can find them
- Know the location of electrical shutoffs
- Have a plan for relocating product if needed
- Understand your insurance coverage for spoilage
- Keep dry ice or backup cooling options available
