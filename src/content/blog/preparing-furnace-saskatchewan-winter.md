Saskatchewan winters are no joke. With temperatures regularly dropping below -30°C and cold snaps reaching -40°C or colder, your furnace isn't just a comfort feature—it's essential for your family's safety. Here's how to make sure your heating system is ready for whatever winter throws at it.

## Schedule a Professional Tune-Up

The single most important thing you can do is have your furnace professionally serviced before the heating season begins. A certified HVAC technician will:

- Clean and inspect the heat exchanger for cracks (a cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide)
- Check and adjust the burner assembly
- Test safety controls and limit switches
- Inspect the flue pipe for proper venting
- Measure gas pressure and combustion efficiency
- Lubricate moving parts
- Check electrical connections

Ideally, schedule your furnace tune-up in September or early October, before the rush of emergency calls begins.

## Replace Your Furnace Filter

A dirty filter restricts airflow, making your furnace work harder and less efficiently. In Saskatchewan's dry winter air, dust accumulates quickly. We recommend:

- **Standard 1-inch filters**: Replace monthly during heating season
- **Pleated filters**: Replace every 2-3 months
- **High-efficiency filters**: Follow manufacturer recommendations, typically 3-6 months

Pro tip: Stock up on filters before winter so you always have replacements on hand.

## Test Your Thermostat

Before the cold hits, make sure your thermostat is working properly:

1. Set the temperature a few degrees above the current room temperature
2. Listen for the furnace to kick on within a minute or two
3. Feel warm air coming from your vents within 5 minutes
4. Make sure the system cycles off when the set temperature is reached

If you have an older mechanical thermostat, consider upgrading to a programmable or smart thermostat. You can save up to 10% on heating costs by lowering the temperature while you're asleep or away.

## Check Your Carbon Monoxide Detectors

Every home with a gas furnace should have carbon monoxide detectors on each level. Before winter:

- Test each detector using the test button
- Replace batteries (even if they seem fine)
- Replace detectors that are more than 5-7 years old
- Make sure there's a detector near sleeping areas

Carbon monoxide is odourless and colourless. Working detectors are your family's first line of defence.

## Clear the Area Around Your Furnace

Your furnace needs proper airflow to operate safely and efficiently:

- Keep at least 3 feet of clearance around the unit
- Don't store chemicals, paints, or flammable materials nearby
- Make sure the furnace room isn't being used for storage
- Clear any debris from around the outdoor vent

## Know the Warning Signs

Learn to recognize signs that your furnace needs attention:

- **Yellow or flickering flame** (should be blue and steady)
- **Unusual sounds** like banging, squealing, or rattling
- **Frequent cycling** on and off
- **Cold spots** in your home
- **Higher than normal energy bills**
- **Visible rust or cracks** on the unit

If you notice any of these issues, call a professional before they become emergencies.

## Have an Emergency Plan

Even with proper maintenance, breakdowns can happen. Be prepared:

- Keep the number of a reliable HVAC service company handy
- Know how to shut off your furnace in an emergency
- Have a backup heat source like a portable electric heater for short-term use
- Know where to go if you need to leave your home during a heating emergency

## When to Consider Replacement

If your furnace is 15-20 years old, it may be more cost-effective to replace it rather than repair it. Modern high-efficiency furnaces (96%+ AFUE) can significantly reduce your heating bills compared to older 80% efficient models. In Saskatchewan's climate, that efficiency difference adds up quickly.
